# Basic-Scene
A 3d cube in canvas, rendered using Three.js

Creating a scene using Three.js - 
                                Starting with the base files - a plain HTML file and a Script.js file. 
Download and insert Three.min.js file to import some classes of Three.js library.

For creating a CUBE - 
we need Geometry, material and by combining them a Mesh will be created.

--Adding the Mesh to the scene is really important--
Set up a CAMERA in Perspective View, and then the scene will be rendered from the Camera Point of view.
